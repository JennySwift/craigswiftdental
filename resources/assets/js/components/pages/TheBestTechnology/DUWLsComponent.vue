        <p>Studies have found that many dental practices world wide have water from their drills, scalers and air/water
            syringes that does not reach the standard of being as clean and safe as household tap water. This is because
            the small tubing in the dental lines is prone to collecting germs.</p>
        <p>We have solved this problem by installing a state of the art system that purifies the water and effectively
            kills germs through our own ozone generator.</p>
        <p>Ozone is now used widely for treatment of reticulated water and bottled water as an alternative to
            traditional chemicals such as chlorine. The largest ozone water treatment plant in the world is in Los
            Angeles and the largest in Australia is in Sydney. Ozone's germ killing ability is 2500 times greater than
            chlorine and yet leaves no harmful chemicals because it breaks down to form oxygen.</p>
        <p>We regularly test the quality of our water and it is of the highest quality for purity and lack of
            germs.</p>
        <p>Your health and safety during your visit is of utmost importance to us.</p>
