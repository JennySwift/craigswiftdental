        <h1>Digital OPG & Cone Beam CT</h1>
        <p>X-ray images and machines have advanced tremendously over recent years. Just like cameras, we are now able
            to use digital technology rather than film. This has enabled the use of much lower doses of radiation to
            obtain good quality images that can be enlarged and made easier for both patient and dentist to see.</p>
        <p>As well as our normal digital dental X-ray machine, we have a new state of the art digital 2D panoramic and
            3D Cone Beam CT machine. This has helped enormously in such things as implants, root canal therapies, and
            extractions, to see things that before were impossible and enable us to do the best, most accurate dentistry
            possible.</p>
