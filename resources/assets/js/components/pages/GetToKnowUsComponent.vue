        <h1>Get To Know Us</h1>
        <p>I have been a dentist for over 36 years, and I consider it a privilege to have been in Bexley North caring
            for the dental needs of locals and not-so-locals for over 31 years.</p>
        <p>I enjoy helping people achieve optimal oral health, and understand this to be a team effort.</p>
        <p>Keeping up to date with new treatment options, clinical technology and materials is important to me. I am a
            problem-solver by nature, and I take satisfaction in making the best treatment options available to my
            patients - the same options I want for myself and my family.</p>
        <p>The friendly voice you will hear when you call to schedule an appointment or ask a question belongs to my
            wife of 34 years, Anita. Being a great team is one of the things that makes our work so enjoyable.</p>
        <p>When we are not in the dental surgery we enjoy long walks together - getting our hearts pumping in the fresh
            air and glorious beauty of the Blue Mountains National Park.</p>
