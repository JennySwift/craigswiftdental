        <h1>Intraoral Camera</h1>
        <p>The intraoral camera is wonderful for taking close up photographs of what is going on in your mouth. I often get photographs so that you can clearly see what is there and we can work out together what you would like done about it. I can also take "after" photographs to show you what has been done. It is also helpful for monitoring things to see if they are stable or deteriorating.</p>
