        <h1>Operating Microscope</h1>
        <p>Many of my patients appreciate the opportunity to view their treatment via the camera attached to my operating microscope.</p>

        <p>The microscope is relatively new to dentistry. There are only a small percentage of dentists who have them
            but the number is steadily growing.</p>
        <p>Many surgeons are now using microscopes in hospitals and many dental specialists are using them because they
            enhance our vision of small objects like teeth and thus help us to do better quality work.</p>
        <p>Imagine working on a small part of a tooth and being able to see it 10 or 20 times larger than you can
            normally see it. You can see and do things that are impossible with the naked eye.</p>
        <p>The microscope is state of the art for achieving high quality dentistry.</p>
        <p>I want to do the best work that I can possibly do so the microscope was a clear choice. I have been using it
            now for ... years, being one of the first dentists in Australia to purchase one. For many detailed aspects
            of dentistry I would not ever want to go back to working without it.</p>
        <p>The other big advantage for patients, is that when desired, you are able to see on a ceiling monitor what I
            see. You can see the problems in your mouth, what has caused them and what the solutions are. You can see
            where the plaque is on your teeth, and where the gums are red and bleed easily so you know where to work on
            with your cleaning at home.</p>
        <p>Many patients also enjoy seeing what I do to help them achieve the health, function and aesthetics that they
            desire. They find it interesting watching my patience, perseverance and skill to achieve the desired
            outcome.</p>
        <p>For some patients the fear of the unknown is very real. These patients say that the microscope really helps
            them to relax because they can see exactly what is happening and why.</p>
        <p>Children especially like seeing their mouth up on the screen, and we can also have some fun seeing a toy, or
            their finger up close. This often helps on their first visit.</p>
        <p>Of course their are times when you may prefer not to watch, so we can turn off the monitor if you desire, or
            you can just close your eyes if you prefer.</p>
